# BovineLabs Core

BovineLabs Core provides extensions, containers, and tools for building games with Unity DOTS (Data-Oriented Technology Stack).

## Installation

Use the version that matches your Unity Entities version. The incremental versions do not have to match. For example, users on Entities 1.3.X should use Core 1.3.Y.

The latest version of the library is available on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/tertle/com.bovinelabs.core). The project is actively worked on daily in various branches.

Every month or so, a new stable version is pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/tertle/com.bovinelabs.core) and [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/packages/com.bovinelabs.core/).

Once installed, the library provides utilities, custom containers, and high-performance extensions without disrupting your existing workflow.

## Extensions

The Core library maintains the status quo in your project by default. However, there are powerful features that can be manually enabled, which may require changes to your workflow. To enable these features, navigate to the `BovineLabs -> Toggle Features` menu.

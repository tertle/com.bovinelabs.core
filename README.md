# BovineLabs Core
BovineLabs Core is a library that provides numerous extensions, new containers, and tools for building games with DOTS (Data-Oriented Technology Stack).

For support and discussions, join [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTsw6Cxvw3).

If you want to support my work or get access to a few private libraries, [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/bovinelabs).

## Installation

Stick to the version that matches your entities version. The incremental versions do not have to match. For example, users on Entities 1.0.X stick with Core 1.0.Y.

The latest version of the library is available on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/tertle/com.bovinelabs.core). The project is actively worked on daily in various branches.

Every month or so, a new stable version is pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/tertle/com.bovinelabs.core) and [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/packages/com.bovinelabs.core/).

Once the library is installed, it grants you access to various utilities, custom containers, and high-performance extensions that should not cause any changes to your workflow. 

## Features
Features I have documented are listed below. This is but a tiny fraction of the features however I'm going to try to start documenting more so this list should hopefully grow.

## Sample
A default project is setup with all features enabled via the package manager samples.

## Toggle Features

The Core library strives to maintain the status quo in your project by default. However, there is a collection of powerful features that can be manually enabled, which may require changes to your workflow. To enable these features, navigate to the `BovineLabs -> Toggle Features` menu.
